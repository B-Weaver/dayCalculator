# dayCalculator
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I designed a class in the header file "typeDay.h" for the original day, new day, and the functions. In the implementation file "dayImplementation" I utilized enumeration, switch case, and recursive functions. The main function is located in the file titled "typeDayMain" and creates an object of class "typeDay" then calls the function "setDay". The user will set the current day and then the recursive functions begin to work. In the first class function called I used an if statement to test the input. An error message will be printed and the program will exit if the user inputs invalid data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user is prompted with a menu to choose an action to perform. The user can view the next day, the previous day, or enter an integer and see what day it would be after adding to the current day or subtracting from the current day, if the entered integer is negative. The recursive functions allow the user to stay in the program until they wish to exit at the menu. </p>
