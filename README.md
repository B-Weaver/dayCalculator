# dayCalculator
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is used to calculate what day of the week it will be based on the users choice of actions after entering the current day. After the initial string input the program operates using only integers to find the new day. I designed a class in the header file "typeDay.h" for the original day, new day, and the functions. In the implementation file "dayImplementation" I utilized switch cases and recursive functions. The main function is located in the file titled "typeDayMain" and creates an object of class "typeDay" then calls the function "setDay". The user will set the current day and then the recursive functions begin to work. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first class function called I used an if statement to test the input. An error message will be printed and the program will exit if the user inputs invalid data. After the the function verifies the input is valid the user is prompted with a menu to choose an action to perform. The first three actions allow the user to view the current, next, or previous day. The fourth and final action allows the user to enter a positive or negative integer to see what day it would be after adding to the current day or subtracting from the current day. The recursive functions allow the user to stay in the program until they wish to exit at the menu.</p>
